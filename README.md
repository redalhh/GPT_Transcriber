# GPT_Transcriber


The GPT Transcriber is a Tampermonkey user script that enhances the ChatGPT web interface by adding voice input capabilities. With this script, you can use speech recognition to provide input to the ChatGPT interface, making it more accessible and convenient.

# Features

Integrated Voice Input: Easily transcribe your speech and insert it into the text area for ChatGPT.

Multiple Language Support: Voice recognition supports English (en-US), Arabic (ar-AR), French (fr-FR), and Moroccan Arabic (ar-MA).

Microphone Icon: A microphone icon indicates when voice input is active.

Transcription Feedback: See your transcribed speech instantly in the ChatGPT interface.


# How to Use

Install the Tampermonkey extension for your browser (if not already installed).

Copy the script code from this GitHub repository.

Create a new script in Tampermonkey and paste the code into the editor.

Save the script, and it will automatically run on the ChatGPT website (https://chat.openai.com/).


# How it Works

The user script utilizes the Web Speech API for speech recognition.

It listens for voice input when the microphone icon is clicked, transcribes the speech, and inserts it into the ChatGPT text area.

You can start and stop the voice input by clicking the microphone icon.

# Compatibility
